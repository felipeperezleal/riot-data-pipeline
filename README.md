# riot-data-pipeline
This project implements a data pipeline for extracting, processing, and analyzing game data from the Riot Games API. The pipeline ingests real-time game statistics and player details, performs ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations using Apache Spark, and stores the processed data in a PostgreSQL data warehouse.
